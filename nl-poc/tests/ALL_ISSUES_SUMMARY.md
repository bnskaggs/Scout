# Complete Summary: All 4 Issues Fixed

## Overview

Fixed 4 improvements/bugs in the NL analytics system, focusing on data formatting, date logic, and narrative accuracy.

---

## Issue #1: Format change_pct with % sign and 2 decimals ✓

### Problem
MoM queries showed raw decimals (`0.156789`) instead of formatted percentages (`+15.68%`)

### Solution
- **Backend (app/main.py):** Added `_format_change_pct()` function
- **Frontend (index.html):** Hide raw column, show formatted version
- **Format:** `+15.68%` (with sign, 2 decimals)

### Impact
- Table now shows readable percentages
- Null values display as "N/A"
- Raw values preserved for calculations

### Files Modified
- `app/main.py` - Added formatting function
- `frontend/index.html` - Hide raw column in table

### Tests
- `tests/test_format_change_pct.py` - All passing

---

## Issue #2: Date logic using wrong current date ✓

### Problems
- **Bug 2A:** "last year" returned Nov 2024-Oct 2025 instead of Oct 2024-Oct 2025
- **Bug 2B:** YTD logic was actually correct (no fix needed)

### Root Cause
"last year" used `-11` month shift instead of `-12` months

### Solution
Changed `_shift_month(anchor, -11)` → `_shift_month(anchor, -12)` in two places:
1. `parse_relative_range()` - "last year" logic
2. `trailing_year_range()` - Default for trend queries

### Impact
- "last year" now starts from same month last year (Oct 2024), not one month later
- 13 months inclusive range matches user expectations
- YTD already worked correctly

### Files Modified
- `app/time_utils.py` - Lines 151 and 203

### Tests
- `tests/test_date_logic_issue2.py` - All passing

---

## Issue #3: MoM header shows wrong "leader" ✓

### Problems
1. Header showed highest count instead of highest change_pct
2. Query asked "rose the most" but showed item that DECREASED
3. Wrong percentage scale (0.2% instead of 20%)

### Root Cause
`build_narrative()` always used `records[0]` (typically sorted by count), and didn't multiply change_pct by 100 for display

### Solution
1. **Pick max change_pct:** For comparison queries, find record with highest change_pct
2. **Fix percentage:** Multiply by 100 before formatting

### Impact
**Before:** "VEHICLE - STOLEN led with 2183 incidents; (down 0.2%)"
**After:** "BURGLARY led with 850 incidents; (up 25.0%)"

Now shows the item that actually increased the most!

### Files Modified
- `app/viz.py` - Modified `build_narrative()` function

### Tests
- `tests/test_mom_header_leader.py` - All passing

---

## Issue #4: Misleading "led with" for bottom queries ✓

### Problem
Bottom queries said "led with" which implies highest, not lowest

### Root Cause
Narrative didn't check sort direction (`order_by: {dir: "asc"}` for bottom queries)

### Solution
Check if `order_by` has `dir == "asc"`:
- **Ascending:** Use "had the fewest"
- **Descending/Default:** Use "led with"

### Impact
**Before:** "Hollenbeck led with 271 incidents" (confusing!)
**After:** "Hollenbeck had the fewest with 271 incidents" (clear!)

### Files Modified
- `app/viz.py` - Modified `build_narrative()` function

### Tests
- `tests/test_bottom_query_header.py` - All passing

---

## Summary of Changes

### Files Modified
1. **app/main.py**
   - Added `_format_change_pct()` function
   - Apply formatting before returning records

2. **app/time_utils.py**
   - Changed `-11` to `-12` in "last year" logic (2 places)

3. **app/viz.py**
   - Pick record with max change_pct for comparison queries
   - Fix percentage formatting (* 100)
   - Use context-aware language ("had the fewest" vs "led with")

4. **frontend/index.html**
   - Hide raw change_pct column when formatted version exists

### Test Coverage
All new tests passing:
- `test_format_change_pct.py` (6 tests)
- `test_date_logic_issue2.py` (4 tests)
- `test_mom_header_leader.py` (4 tests)
- `test_bottom_query_header.py` (4 tests)

**Total: 18 new tests, 100% passing**

## Before/After User Experience

### Issue #1: Change Percentages
**Before:** `change_pct: 0.156789`
**After:** `change_pct_formatted: +15.68%`

### Issue #2: Date Ranges
**Before:** "last year" = Nov 2024-Oct 2025
**After:** "last year" = Oct 2024-Oct 2025

### Issue #3: MoM Headers
**Before:** Shows highest count with wrong percentage
**After:** Shows highest change with correct percentage

### Issue #4: Bottom Query Language
**Before:** "X led with Y incidents" (misleading)
**After:** "X had the fewest with Y incidents" (clear)

## Impact Summary

✅ **More accurate** - Headers show correct items
✅ **More intuitive** - Language matches query intent
✅ **Better formatted** - Percentages readable
✅ **Correct dates** - Time ranges match expectations

All changes are backward compatible and surgical (minimal diffs).
